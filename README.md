# Dinossaur-Jumping-game
Dinossaur jumping game built in Assembly language for the P4 processor (coded in portuguese language for a University project)

Welcome!

I made this project for a class called 'Introduction to Computer Architecture' using Assembly language, during the first year of my Computer Science and Engineering degree.

The game had the goal of being as similarly as possible to the Google Chrome dino game (offline) and it can be played in a processor called P4, which is a processor made by my University.

To play the game, simply download the .as file and then open the file in the following link: http://p4.rnl.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/ (using the button 'Open...' and then click 'Run').

The code and all the comments inside the project are all made in Portuguese.

Hope you enjoy it!

Best wishes, Nuno Martins
